1. 4DVAR talk can be shortened by 10 minutes. Still needs more material though (at least talk about precipitation)

2. FSO talk can be dropped or (more likely) combined with TOOLS talk 

3. Should add Radar talk

4. Start both days at 8:30, end both at 5:30? Should at least be consistent.

5. Add practice sessions:
   - FSO
   - Add a page specifically for scripts/visualization, and link where appropriate 

6. In pre-compiled code, link da_wrfvar_3dvar.exe as da_wrfvar.exe, so that
scripts such as FSO and Cycling will work with pre-compiled code that users
download

7. Need to find a way to emphasise the concept of a working directory.
