The code has been modified plenty to get it compiled and linked.  As is,
it will only run serially and without physics.  There is a makefile for
compiling with the physics routines that came with this core, but there are
several files that are distant cousins of files also found in the "phys"
subdirectory.  So either these files must be renamed or some time taken to
get the different versions to agree.  It is also worth noting that Tom Black
of NCEP has been working on newer versions of some of the physics routines
and his work should be included before much effort is put into the physics
files that are here.
