Review of current developments (from <ahref="http://box.mmm.ucar.edu/individual/barker/wrf-var/code_log/code_log.htm">WRF-VarDevelopment table</a>):</b></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Update on KMA project: </span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:green'>Wei informed that global 3dvar hasbeen updated for MPP. Rizvi tested the updated code on “cape” and IBM(bluesky). Multi processor run produced similar results. Since on IBM, T213code cannot run using single processor so the muti-processor run results couldnot be compared with single processor run. However, similar exercise wasperformed for T63 and it produced same results. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:green'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:green'>Mr. Shin’s changes for “globalconverter” part have been integrated with global 3dvar code. </span><spanstyle='color:red'>The code compiles on CRAY and both Wei and Shin are testingit on CRAY. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:green'>Rizvi will test end-to-end global3dvar run at T213 resolution on “Dec” and IBM machines</span><spanstyle='color:black'>. </span><span style='color:red'>Wei will run on CARY-X1and the results will be compared.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'> </span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>The convergence test with fullglobal dataset for a particular case (12 UTC, 27 October, 2004) will beperformed by increasing inner loop limit to 1000 and various diagnostics willbe studied.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:green'>Wei informed that the global 3dvarcode sent to Mi-Seon includes TC_Bogus  &amp; global changes. It does notinclude the “gen_be” part. Mi-Seon has already compiled this code successfullyon CRAY machine with KMA. For MPP version, she has been advised to updatenamelist with nproc_y = 1. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>Before 15<sup>th</sup> April, 2005 Weihas to merge Mi-Seon changes in global 3dvar for final version to be deliveredto KMA. Obs preporcessor also needs to be tested along with global 3dvar. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Update on Background error code: </p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:green'>Dale informed that new BE code(gen_be) has been tested for NMC method in AMPS region</span>. <spanstyle='color:#FF6600'>However, few changes needs to be made before its finaldelivery to for KMA.</span> Currently there are six  bins-type. In case of binsmade with height, in certain cases, there may not be any point in some bins.Thus lat/model levels approach needs to be considered.</p><p class=MsoNormal>For KMA global, using NMC method BE-stats looks ok and thecode runs very fast. For regional NMC method, scale length part is very slow.There are some problems for running gen_be code with  ensembale method.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>It was noticed that the rejection in wrf-3dvar for surfacedata is almost 90% and the biases are also very large specially, for thetemperature. For MODIS rejection is about 10% but RMSE is very large (10 mps). Since the V-error is large than U-error indicating there is some problem withmap projection and thus needs investigation)<span style='color:red'>. Daleproposed to add various diagnostics in “da_3dvar/utl” directory for tuningbackground errors and scale length parameters using Hollingworth approach. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Yong-Run tried three <span style='color:red'>different formulationsfor computing innovation vector of Total Zenith delay, </span>using verticalintegration and surface pressure. All these methods are giving differentresults, which<span style='color:red'> needs investigation.</span> However, allthe methods passed adjoint test. </p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>Wrf-3dvar for giving separatetreatment to Polar and Geostationary atmospheric motion</span> vectors (AMV),developed by Rizvi <span style='color:red'>needs to be reviewed.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>4DVAR Development:</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><pre>Qingnong informed that there are only about <span style='color:red'>6-7 subroutines left for adjoint testing.</span> Wei’s help was required to look into these subroutines. Dr. Hans informed that changes for <spanstyle='color:red'>“clock adjustment”  in wrf-code for backward integration of WRF-model</span> also needs Wei’s attention. It was agreed that Wei will look into these two issues next week after finishing the task of delivery of global 3dvar code to KMA. </pre><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Project Spotlight: ?</b></p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Since the new background error code (gen_be) is not designedto accept input from MM5 model, it was suggested that we should encourage allusers use WRF model output for generating BE. </p><p class=MsoNormal> </p><p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Review of future, and additional proposed changes.</b></p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Wei discussed an efficient way of using CVS repository codeby using “Branch” version rather than “Tagged” version. It seems that theconcept of using “Branch” version makes life easy for merging the developmentin the main CVS-repository. It was suggested that Wei should write a smallwrite up on this new concept and circulate. </p><p class=MsoNormal> </p><p class=MsoNormal><b>4. AOB</b></p><p class=MsoNormal>Their was serious concern expressed about the compiling timeof wrf3dvar code. As an example, “frame” part needs only two subroutines from“physics” module thus if it gets moved to frame, compilation time will be verymuch reduced. Such problem needs to be discussed with WRF-development group.</p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><b>Next meeting: Room 207210am-11am 26 April 2005.</b></span></p></div></body></html>
