  Brief details about verif package:
-------------------------------------
   
  Verif package is designed to verify any analysis or forecasts (obtained with various experiments) against
  any given set of observations collectively or with respect to any individual set (type) of Observations.
  It generates (using NCL) multiple xy-plots (time series and average vertical profiles) for RMSE, BIAS etc.
  Entire "verif" procedure is residing in "da/da_verif" under main wrfvar directory.

  It holds following subdirectories/files:
    
   a) src:
      Directory containing all the source code 


   b) scripts:
      Directory holding two NCL scripts to plot time series and average vertical profiles for 
      various scores like RMSE, BIAS etc.
 
   c) Makefile
      Standard makefile for compiling the code under src
  
   d) verif_plot.ksh
      Main shell script to run the whole verif procedure. 

 Note:  This is the only file (first 20 lines) which needs to be modified to run verif procedure. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  How verif package works?
-------------------------------------
   
  It works as follows.

  Step 1: For each verification experiment (Analysis or forecasts) run WRF-Var with namelist 
          variable analysis_type ="verify" or "VERIFY" for the desired number of days with
          specific cycling time.

          Correspondig to each experiment, Step 1 will generate "gts_omb_oma" files in working 
          directories (wrfvar/working) for each time. These will form the input data set for this
          package.

  Step 2:  Modify verif_plot.ksh  to fix the folllowing:

         i)  RUN_DIR	: User defied run directory for generating  plots etc.
        ii)  DIAG_DIR 	: User defined input directory holding all the directories for 
                          each experiments generated in Step 1. 
                          For example "gts_omb_oma" file corresponding to experiment 
                          "verify_12" (directory name for 12 hour forecast verification) 
                          for "2005081700" will reside as follows
                          
                           $DIAG_DIR/verify_12/2005081700/wrfvar/working/gts_omb_oma       

        iii) START_DATE	: Starting date ("YYYYMMDDHH") for verification
    
        iv)  END_DATE	: Ending date ("YYYYMMDDHH") for verification
    
        v)   INTERVAL	: Time interval (in hours) for incrementing date/time.
             
          Note: It will look for "gts_omb_oma" file for each date/time and so make sure that
                it available for each Days/Time.

       vi) Verify_Date_Range:   
           User defined string to specify title for X-axis plots.

       vii) NUM_EXPT :
             Number of experiments (integer). Maximum allowed 10.
       
       viii) EXP_NAMES :
             All experiment directory names as they exist in $DIAG_DIR separated by blank.  

       ix)   NUM_OBS_TYPE:
             Number of observation types for verification 

       x) OBS_TYPES	: 
            Verification observation types (like "synop", "buoy", "sound" etc. seperated by blanks.  
                                             These names are to be specified in lower case)
       xi) DESIRED_LEVELS:   
             Desired pressure levels (in hPa) for ploting diagnostics
       
       xii) DESIRED_SCORES:  
             Desired diagnostics like "RMSE", "BIAS" or "ABIAS" 
 
       xiii) EXP_LEGENDS : Legend strings for each experiments respectively, separated by comma.

       xiv)  EXP_LINES_COLORS : Color sequence (a set of strings) for various experiments.

       xv)   PLOT_WKS:  
             Name of workstation for plots like "X11", "pdf" etc.

       xiii) WRFVAR_DIR:

             Full path for WRF-Var main directory
      

  Step3:  Execute verif_plot.ksh script
          It will genetrate "pdf" files in $RUN_DIR 



   Further scope for upgrade (wish list):
    a) Adding levelwise significance test (T-test) for various expriments.
    b) Script for "OMB" & "OMA" (togather) plot.
    c) Addition of verification for observations GPSPW, GPS refractivity, Radar radial velocity & refelctivity etc. 
    d) Precipitation forecasts verifiaction
