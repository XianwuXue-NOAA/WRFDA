.TH MPE_Init_log 3 "8/5/2007" " " "MPE"
.SH NAME
MPE_Init_log \-  Initialize the logging of events. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
int MPE_Init_log( void )
.fi
.SH NOTES
This routine must be called before any of the other MPE logging routines.
It is a collective call over 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.
MPE_Init_log() & MPE_Finish_log() are NOT needed when liblmpe.a is linked
because MPI_Init() would have called MPE_Init_log() already.
liblmpe.a will be included in the final executable if it is linked with
either "mpicc -mpe=mpilog" or "mpecc -mpilog"

.SH RETURNS
Always return MPE_LOG_OK.

.SH SEE ALSO
MPE_Finish_log()
