.TH MPE_Finish_log 3 "8/5/2007" " " "MPE"
.SH NAME
MPE_Finish_log \-  Send log to master, who writes it out 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
int MPE_Finish_log( const char *filename )
.fi
.SH NOTES
MPE_Finish_log() & MPE_Init_log() are NOT needed when liblmpe.a is linked
because MPI_Finalize() would have called MPE_Finish_log() already.
liblmpe.a will be included in the final executable if it is linked with
either "mpicc -mpe=mpilog" or "mpecc -mpilog"

This routine outputs the logfile in CLOG2 format, i.e.
a collective call over 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.
