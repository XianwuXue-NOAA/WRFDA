<p>The analysis variables, defined on the grid, are: stream function (S); unbalanced part of
velocity potential (Z<sub>u</sub>); the unbalanced part of temperature (T<sub>u</sub>); unbalanced part of surface
pressure(P<sub>u</sub>); and pseudo relative humidity (water vapor mixing ratio divided by the saturated
value from the guess field, Dee and Da Silva, 2002 ).</p>

<p>The background error <strong>B </strong>can be written as<strong> </strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(VB<sub>z</sub> B<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>) (VB<sub>z</sub> B<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>)<font size="-1"><sup>T</sup></font></strong><font size="-1"></font></li>

<p>The amplitudes and scales of the default background error statistics are defined as functions
of latitude and height on the global domain. (default statistics file: wrfstat) These statistics are
automatically interpolated to any user defined WRF domain and grid. The input parameters
as1, as2, as3, as4, as5 in record11 are the tuning coefficients for the five analysis variables.
These parameters are arrays with 3 elements each for variance, horizontal scale and vertical
scale respectively.</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>Calculation of Balanced Part Variables</strong></font></p>

<p>For 3D Var in physical space, the multivariate coupling between the mass and wind variables
is challenging. Since the variables are defined in physical space, it is not easy to apply a
linear balance operator (Parrish &amp; Derber 1992) which includes the inverse of the Laplacian
operator. However, the relation between the mass field and the stream function is linear, so
that statistical regression between the two is possible.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The balanced part of the temperature increment is defined as T<sub>b</sub> =<strong>G</strong><em>S</em> where matrix <strong>G</strong> projects
stream function increments to a vertical profile of the balanced part of temperature
increments. Linear regression is used to calculate the <strong>G</strong> matrix. Since the variables are
defined on the grid this matrix can be latitude dependent. The balanced part of the surface
pressure increment is defined as P<sub>b</sub> = <strong>W</strong><em>S</em>   where matrix <strong>W</strong> integrates the appropriate
contribution of the stream function from each level. The balance design is crucial; the
assimilation degrades quickly without it. For example, without mass-wind balance the fit of
the guess field to the surface pressure observations worsens with time and doubles in
magnitude within two days (8 cycles) of the assimilation. However <em>with</em> statistical linear
balance defined in the analysis variables, the quality of the first guess field is maintained.</p>

<p>     </p>

<p>A vertically localized correlation between the velocity potential and the stream function is
also implemented to take into account the positive correlation between divergence and
vorticity in the planetary boundary layer. The balanced part of the velocity potential is
defined as Z<sub>b</sub> = <em>c</em> <em>S</em> where coefficient <em>c</em> is a function of latitude and height.</p>

<p><strong>Subroutine:</strong> DA_VToX_Transforms/da_transform_bal.inc</p>

<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2">
<p>The balance projection is included as part of the forward operator <strong>H</strong>. For example, calculation
of  <strong>H</strong><sup>T <strong> </strong></sup><strong></strong><strong>R</strong><sup>-1 </sup> (<strong>Hx</strong>-<strong>y</strong> ) involves the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculate T<sub>b</sub>, Z<sub>b</sub> and P<sub>b</sub> from the analysis variable <em>S</em> and add them to the unbalanced
parts to obtain the total fields.</li>
  <li>convert <em>S</em> and <em>Z</em> to U and V wind components.</li>
  <li>observational forward model of the observation, e.g., interpolation to the observation
location for most of the conventional data.</li>
  <li>calculate the residual, multiply by <strong>R</strong><sup>-1</sup>, 				</li>
  <li>apply the adjoint of the first three steps in reverse order.</li>

<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong></strong></font><font color="#0000ff"><strong>Estimation of Default Background Error Covariance</strong></font><strong></strong></p>

<p>The error variance is estimated in grid space by what has become
known as the NMC method
(Parrish and Derber 1992) . The statistics are estimated with the
differences of 24 and 48-hour GFS forecasts with T170 resolution valid
at the same time for 357 cases distributed over
a period of one year. Both the amplitudes and the scales of the
background error have to be
tuned to represent the (6-hr? 3-hr?) forecast error in the guess
fields. This is the reason for
the tuning parameters mentioned above. The statistics that project
multivariate relations
among variables are also derived from the NMC method.</p>

<p>The variance of each variable and the variance of its second derivative are used to estimate its
horizontal scales. For example, the horizontal scales of the stream function can be estimated
from the variance of the vorticity and stream function.</p>

<p>The vertical scales are estimated with the vertical correlation of each variable. A table is built
to cover the range of vertical scales for the variables. The table is then used to find the scales
in vertical grid units. The filter profile and the vertical correlation are fitted locally.  The
scale of the best fit from the table is assigned as the scale of the variable at that vertical level
for each latitude. Note that the vertical scales are locally defined so that the negative
correlation further away in the vertical direction is not included.</p>

<br wp="BR1"><br wp="BR2">
<p>The steps to produce the error statistics are</p>

<ul>
  <li>use least-squares fit to find the multivariate projection arrays.</li>
  <li>subtract balanced part, calculated with the projection arrays, from the total error fields</li>
  <li>calculate the variance and scales of the unbalanced fields</li>
