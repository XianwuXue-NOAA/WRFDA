JCSDA CRTM Build Instructions
=============================

0) Several targets are available for specific compilers. The target names are:
     ibm  
     sgi    (untested)  
     sun    (untested)
     intel
     lahey
     pgi  
     g95
   Each target has a corresponding debug target, <name>_debug, that uses the typical
   set of compiler switches for debugging code.
   
   The actual compiler and switch definitions are listed in the "make.macros" files.
   
   The build is OS-sensitive in that the correct compiler is selected based on the
   platform you are one. For example, if you build on an IBM/AIX system, the xlf95
   compiler is invoked. Doing the same on a linux or MacOSX system invokes the
   default linux compiler; currently this is the Lahey f95 compiler.
   
   So, if you want to modify how the CRTM builds (different compiler, different
   switches) editing the "make.macros" file is, for now, your best best.
   Eventually we'll put together something smarter.
   
   For the linux folks out there, the bottom of the "make.macros" file contains
   the following
     LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_LAHEY)
     #LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_PGI)
     #LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_INTEL)
     #LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_G95)
   If you want to change the default linux compiler simply comment out the Lahey
   definition line and uncomment the compiler definition of your choice.


1) Once all the above stuff has been sorted out, to build the CRTM library type

     make [target]
   
   where the optional target is one listed in (0) above.


2) To install the CRTM library in ./lib and ./include directories, type

     make install
     

3) That's really it. Any questions, suggestions, additions, bug reports, etc,
   let me know at
