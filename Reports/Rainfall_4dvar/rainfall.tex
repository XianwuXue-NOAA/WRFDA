Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) approach is used directly assimilate precipitation data in Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation system (WRFDA). Three experiments for a 14-day period in June 2010 are performed to assess the impact of precipitation assimilation on short-range forecasts. Precipitation assimilation has a positive impact on model fields, particularly the low level humidity analyses, 12-h and 24-h forecasts. It also improves the GSS scores for 12-h and 24-h accumulated precipitation for the threshold from 1mm to 30mm and makes the forecasts of precipitation quantity and pattern closer to observations.

\section{Introduction}

A proper description of the hydrological cycle is vital for short-range forecasting with regional operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models \citep{Macpherson}. 
In the past few decades, the assimilation of precipitation observations using four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) method have been developed to improve the model initial states, and hence, to improve the skill of short-range forecasts.

%Meanwhile, the accuracy of short-range NWP is largely affected by the model initial condition. Many studies \citep{Zupanski,Zou,Tsuyuki,Xiao,Guo} indicate that the assimilation of precipitation observations can provide accurate mesoscale initial states, and hence, it is expected to improve the skill of short-range forecasts.

%In the past few decades, several approaches to assimilation of precipitation observations in NWP models have been developed.
%The first approach is initialization scheme (or “reverse” scheme), such as the dynamical initialization (Fiorino and Warner 1981), physical initialization(Krishnamurti et al. 1991, 1993; ) and cumulus convection initialization (Kasahara et al. 1992;Donner, 1988).The papers mentioned above all showed that an improved forecast could be obtained after incorporation of the observed rainfall rate. However, it is an indirect way of using precipitation data, and the shortcoming of the technique is that it does not guarantee dynamically consistent initial conditions (Zou et al. 1996).
%The second method is to use nudging technique (Carr and Baldwin, 1991; Kuo et al, 1993; Manobianco et al. 1994; Chang and Holt 1994; Lin et al. 1999; Falkovich et al. 2000; Macpherson 2001). Although it is one of the simplest methods of data assimilation and computationally much more economical, the nudging-generated initial conditions, like the first method, are also dynamically inconsistent(Zou et al. 1996, Bao and Errico, 1997).
%The third approach is to use variational data assimilation, such as, 1D-Var, 3D-Var, 1D-Var+4D-Var, and 4D-Var. We will not go into many details about 1D-Var and 3D-Var assimilating rainfall data, and more information can be found in the following papers (1D-Var: Hou et al. 2004; 3D-Var, Treadon et al. 2002). 

The first attempt to assimilate precipitation observations using four 4D-Var approaches was made by Zupanski and Mesinger in 1995. They demonstrated the technical feasibility of the approach and showed an improvement of precipitation forecast in mid-latitudes by using a regional NMC eta forecast model and an incomplete adjoint model. Later, many studyies \citep{Zou,Tsuyuki,Xiao,Guo} indicated that the precipitation assimilation leads to a reduction in the spin-up time, improves the moisture distributions in model initial conditions and improves the skill of short-range forecasts. Some operational weather services also assimilate precipitation operationally using 4D-Var method, including Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) \citep{Koizumi} and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)  \citep{Lopez}. %Although the results of studies mentioned above are encouraging, the precipitation assimilation in 4D-Var is still a challenging issue. %Just as Errico et al. [2000] mentioned that the assimilation of precipitation-related observations is potentially very different than that of more conventional observation types for a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. In order to use precipitation data in 4D-Var, it is necessary to include parameterization schemes of moist processes into tangent linear model and corresponding adjoint model. However these processes are strongly nonlinear and contain discontinuous (non-differentiable) on/off switches, especially in the case of a cumulus convection parameterization. This makes the tangent linear approximation less valid for a linearized model with physics than for the same model without physics (Tsuyuki, 1997). Thus, development of techniques of the 4D-Var data assimilation with realistic, ‘full-physics’ forecast models must be related to examining and solving these problems first (Zupanski and Mesinger, 1995).
%Compare to the initialization scheme, the 4D-Var can assimilate precipitation data directly, and the major advantages of 4D-Var is that it uses the full model dynamics to adjust the model variables to the observed precipitation (Tsuyuki 1996).

%The assimilation of precipitation-related observations is potentially very different than that of more conventional observation types for a variety of fundamental and practical considerations \citep{Errico}.

Thus, development of techniques of the 4DVAR data assimilation with realistic, ‘full-physics’ forecast models must be related to examining and solving these problems first \citep{Zupanski}. 
\citet{Zhang} reports that the tangent linear and adjoint codes of the WRF model (WRFPLUS) have been redeveloped. It includes simplified model physics packages (e.g., the parameterization of cumulus and microphysics). Moreover, a simplified planet boundary layer process, horizontal and vertical diffusions are also incorporated into the TL and AD model. Taking advantages of the redeveloped WRFPLUS, it is a natural extension to add the precipitation assimilation capability to the WRF Data Assimilation System (WRFDA) \citep{Barker}.

\section{Observations used in assimilation experiments}

%\subsection{NCEP stage IV precipitation data and data processing}

The precipitation observations to be assimilated in this paper are NCEP stage IV precipitation data, 
which is a mosaic of regional multi-sensor analysis produced by National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFCs) and benefits from the RFCs’ manual quality control step \citep{LinMitchell}.
%which combine precipitation estimates from about 150 Doppler Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) with about 5500 hourly rain gauge measurements over the continental United States \citep{LinMitchell}. 
Hourly, 6-hourly and 24-hourly precipitation data were downloaded from the NCAR CODIAC (http://data.eol.ucar.edu/codiac/dss/id=21.093) and converted into the WRFDA readable data format. Observations with innovations greater than 5 times the assumed observation error standard deviation were rejected. Original 4km resolution data were thinned to experiment resolution 30km.

%\subsection{Conventional observation}

Conventional data used in this paper includes land surface, marine surface, radiosonde, pibal and aircraft reports from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) which originated from a wide variety of sources. Quality control is also preformed as described above.

\section{WRFDA 4D-Var}

The prototype version of the WRF 4D-Var system is described in \citet{Huang}. It is based on the incremental variational data assimilation technique. The cost function in the incremental approach is formulated as follows, 

%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
\begin{align}
J(\delta x) &= J_{b}(\delta x)+J_{o}(\delta x)+J_{c}(\delta x) \nonumber \\
& =\frac{1}{2}\delta x^{T}\mathbf{B}^{-1}\delta x\nonumber\\
 & +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{K}(\mathbf{H}_k\mathbf{M}_k \delta x - d_{k})^{T}\mathbf{R}^{-1}(\mathbf{H}_k\mathbf{M}_k \delta x - d_{k})\nonumber\\
 & +J_{c}(\delta x)    
%\end{split}
\end{align}
%\end{equation}

$ \delta x=x_{0}-x_{0}^{b} $  is the analysis increment relative to the model state $ (x_{0}) $ and background $ (x_{0}^{b}) $  at time $0$. $K$ is the total number of time slots on which observations are available. $ \mathbf{B} $ and $ \mathbf{R} $ are covariance matrices for background error and observation error. $ \mathbf{H} $ is the linear approximation of the observation operator $H$  in the vicinity of $ x_{0}^{b} $. $ \mathbf{M} $  is the tangent linear model.  $ d_{k}=y_{k}^{0}-H_k\left[M_k(x_{0}^{b})\right]$ is the innovation vector between observed precipitation $y_{k}^{0}$  and model precipitation at time $k$ . The model precipitation includes non-convective and convective precipitation. The sum of the model precipitation is linearly interpolated to observation location and compared with the observations to generate the innovations. $H$  and $M$  are the nonlinear observation operator and simplified WRF nonlinear model respectively. $J_{c}$  is a balancing term. It measures the quadratic distance between the analysis and a balanced state.

\section{Experiments design and verification methods}
\subsection{Experiments design}

A 14-day period from 0000 UTC 1 to 1200 UTC 14 June 2010 has been selected for running the experiments. This period is chosen because it is characterized by many precipitation events of both convective and stratiform nature. Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW-WRF) \citep{Skamarock} is used as the forecast model. The integration domain of the model covers the North American continent and the surrounding oceans. The horizontal resolution is 30km and there are 40 vertical levels with the model top at 50hPa. The WRF Single-Moment 5-class Microphysics scheme (WSM5)  \citep{Hong}, the Kain-Fritsch cumulus convection scheme \citep{KainFristsch}, and the Yonsei University (YSU) boundary layer parameterization \citep{Hong2006} are used. 

A 6-h spin-up run is conducted using National Center for Environmental Prediction Final Analysis (NCEP FNL) with horizontal spatial resolution of 1.0 x 1.0 degree and the output from the spin-up is used as the initial condition of the COTROL experiment as well as the first guess field for the 4D-Var experiments. The CONTROL experiment serves as the benchmark for evaluating the assimilation experiments. The experiment GTS only assimilates conventional observations, while the experiment RAIN only assimilates NCEP Stage IV 6-hourly accumulated precipitation data. The experiment (GTS+RAIN) assimilates both conventional data and NCEP Stage IV precipitation data. The assimilation window is 6 hours. 2 mm precipitation error is assigned for 6-h accumulated rainfall assimilation. The National Meteorological Center (NMC) method \citep{ParrisDerber} in the WRFDA package is used for background error calculations.
To reduce the computational cost, multi-incremental 4D-Var is used, where the innovation in outer loop is computed with a high-resolution nonlinear model (30 km) and the minimization in inner loop is done with a low-resolution linearized model (90 km). A more detailed description of multi-incremental 4D-Var can be found in \citet{Zhangandhuang} section 3a.

\subsection{Verification methods}

The Model Evaluation Tool (MET) developed by Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) \citep{Brown} is used to evaluate the analyses, 12-h and 24-h forecasts. Two datasets have been used as references. One dataset is the upper air sounding observations, which is used to evaluate model winds, temperature, and relative humidity. Root-mean square errors (RMSEs) are used as the verification metric. The other dataset is the NCEP Stage IV precipitation data. The original precipitation accumulations are available on a 4-km resolution polar-stereographic grid. It has been regrided to 30 km lambert conformal grid before verification. We acquire 12-h, 18-h and 24-h accumulated precipitation by summing of NCEP Stage IV 6-hourly accumulated precipitation. After interpolating and summing, verifications are done by using a grid-to-grid comparison. The Gilbert Skill Score (GSS) \citep{Gilbert} is used as the precipitation verification metric. RMSEs and precipitation scores in section 5 have been calculated for the entire 14-day period of the experiments.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Results} %\label{text}
%The impacts of the precipitation assimilation on the initial fields and forecasts are analyzed in this section through the comparison of the three experiments and with NCEP Stage IV observation.

\subsection{Profile verification}

In order to evaluate how model variables are affected by the precipitation assimilation, RMSEs are computed for wind speed, temperature and relative humidity on different pressure levels.  
Figure 1 gives the vertical profiles of wind speed RMSE for four experiments. The wind speed RMSE of GTS+RAIN and GTS almost overlapped at analysis time (Figure 1a and Figure 2a), and they have significant lower RMSE then CONTROL for all levels. For 12-h and 24-h forecast, although U- and V-component RMSE of three experiments are very close, the results of GTS+RAIN and GTS still better then CONTROL, meanwhile, GTS+RAIN reduced the errors slightly in the middle and lower levels contrast to GTS and CONTROL experiment. The vertical profiles of temperature RMSE for all experiments are shown in Fig. 3. GTS+RAIN reduced the errors for analysis (Fig. 3a) in lower troposphere while RMSEs are almost overlapped in three experiments for 12-h and 24-h forecast. Figure 4 shows the vertical profiles of relative humidity RMSE. GTS+RAIN has significant lower RMSE than GTS and CONTROL at analysis time, 12-h and 24-h forecasts at low levels. \citet{Guo} also reported that humidity was much improved in precipitation assimilation experiment using MM5 data assimilation system.    

\subsection{Precipitation verification}

GSS is used for quantitative verification of the 12-h and 24-h accumulated precipitation at different thresholds. Figure 5 shows threshold series of GSS for 12-h (Figure 5a) and 24-h (Figure 5b) accumulated precipitation for the experiment CONTROL, GTS and GTS+RAIN. For a perfect forecast, GSS is 1. For 12-h and 24-h accumulated precipitation, GTS+RAIN systematically improved the GSS scores. It indicates that the quantitative precipitation forecast can be much improved when we assimilate both conventional and precipitation data.
For 12-h precipitation forecast, GTS produces the lowest GSS. We look into the time series of GSS for the whole period (Figure 6). In general, GTS and CONTROL produce similar results except the obvious difference at 0000 UTC 5, 6 and 12. 
In our experience and previous study \citep{Xu}, the precipitation forecast for GTS+RAIN experiment is sensitive to the assign of precipitation observation error and assimilated precipitation frequency. For example, the precipitation forecasts for threshold greater then 15.0mm almost have no improvement if we use a too small error such as 0.25mm. 

In Figure 7, the forecasts of 12-h accumulated precipitation from 1200 UTC 10 to 0000 UTC 11 June 2010 for three experiments are compared with NCEP Stage IV. In Figure 7a, it shows the rainfall center located in eastern Nebraska, western Lowa and southeastern corner of South Dakota. CONTROL (Figure 7b) does not produce the correct location: the rainfall center shifts northward to southern Minnesota and eastern South Dakota. GTS (Figure 7c) overestimated rainfall in northeastern of South Dakota. In Figure 7d, GTS+RAIN simulates relatively proper amount and distribution of precipitation. It suggests GTS+RAIN experiment succeeded in bringing the model precipitation closer to the observations. 

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we use the WRFDA 4D-Var system to assimilate precipitation data. 
%The multi-incremental 4D-Var option is used to reduce the computational cost. 
A 14-day period containing many precipitation events is selected to assess the performance of precipitation assimilation in WRFDA 4D-Var. Three experiments have been conducted: CONTROL— without assimilation; GTS — assimilation of conventional data and GTS+RAIN— assimilation of both conventional and precipitation data. %The time window is 6 hours for assimilation experiments and 6-h accumulated precipitation data is used. To evaluate how atmospheric variables are affected by the precipitation assimilation, RMSEs are computed for the two components of the vector wind, temperature and relative humidity on different pressure levels. % It is found when we assimilate precipitation data together with conventional data, the RMSEs of wind fields almost have not changed on analysis comparing to the only assimilating precipitation data experiment, but the lower level of the wind fields are slightly improved for 12-h and 24-h forecast.  
%It is found when we assimilate precipitation data together with conventional data,  the lower level of the wind fields are slightly improved for 12-h and 24-h forecast comparing to the only assimilating precipitation data experiment. 
It is found that, when we assimilate precipitation data together with conventional data, the relative humidity RMSEs have been significantly reduced at lower levels, and the RMSEs of wind are slightly improved for 12-h and 24-h forecast comparing to the only assimilating conventional data experiment. 
For precipitation verification, the obvious advantage is presented in GTS+RAIN experiment. The GSS is systematically improved for the threshold from 1mm to 30mm and the forecasts of precipitation quantity and pattern are closer to observation in GTS+RAIN. The results also show that the impact on precipitation forecast is neutral if we only assimilate conventional data, although it improves the vertical profile of RMSEs for the vector wind, temperature and relative humidity. In our experience and previous study, the precipitation forecasts in GTS+RAIN experiment are sensitive to the assign of precipitation observation error and the assimilated precipitation frequency. It will be further investigated in future studies.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with the first character following the equal sign on the first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g. \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
