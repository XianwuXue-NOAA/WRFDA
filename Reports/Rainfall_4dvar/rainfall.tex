\section{Introduction}

A proper description of the hydrological cycle is vital for short-range forecasting with regional operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models \citep{Macpherson}. 
In the past few decades, the assimilation of precipitation observations using four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) method has been developed to improve the model initial states, and hence, to improve the skill of short-range forecasts.

The first attempt to assimilate precipitation observations using 4D-Var approaches was made by \citet{Zupanski}. They demonstrated the technical feasibility of the approach and showed an improvement of precipitation forecast in mid-latitudes by using a regional NMC eta forecast model and an incomplete adjoint model. Later, many studies \citep{Zou,Tsuyuki,Xiao,Guo} indicated that the precipitation assimilation leads to a reduction in the spin-up time, improves the moisture distributions in model initial conditions and improves the skill of short-range forecasts. Some operational weather services also assimilate precipitation operationally using 4D-Var method, including Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) \citep{Koizumi} and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)  \citep{Lopez}. 

In order to use precipitation data in 4D-Var, it is necessary to include moist processes into the tangent linear model and the corresponding adjoint model. 
\citet{Zhang} reports that the tangent linear and adjoint codes of the WRF model (WRFPLUS) have been redeveloped. 
It includes simplified parameterization of cumulus and microphysics,  simplified planet boundary layer process, horizontal and vertical diffusions. 
Taking advantages of the redeveloped WRFPLUS, it is a natural extension to add the precipitation assimilation capability to the WRF Data Assimilation System (WRFDA) 4D-Var \citep{Barker,Huang}. 

This study explores for the first time the impact of the 4D-Var assimilation of precipitation data on forecasts in WRFDA system. Conventional data and NCEP stage IV 6-hourly accumulated precipitation are assimilated.  A 10-day period from 1 to 10 June 2010 has been selected to evaluate the impact of precipitation assimilation on short-range forecasts.

\section{Observations used in assimilation experiments}

%\subsection{NCEP stage IV precipitation data and data processing}

The precipitation observations to be assimilated in this paper are NCEP stage IV precipitation data, 
which is a mosaic of regional multi-sensor analysis produced by National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFCs) and benefits from the RFCs’ manual quality control step \citep{LinMitchell}.
Hourly, 6-hourly and 24-hourly precipitation data were downloaded from the NCAR CODIAC (http://data.eol.ucar.edu/codiac/dss/id=21.093) and converted into the WRFDA readable data format. Observations with innovations greater than 5 times the assumed observation error standard deviation were rejected. Original 4km resolution data were thinned to experiment resolution 30km.

%\subsection{Conventional observation}

Conventional data used in this paper includes land surface, marine surface, radiosonde, pibal and aircraft reports from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) which originated from a wide variety of sources. Quality control was also preformed as described above.

%\section{WRFDA 4D-Var}
%The prototype version of the WRF 4D-Var system is described in \citet{Huang}. It is based on the incremental variational data assimilation technique. The cost function in the incremental approach is formulated as follows, 
%%\begin{equation}
%%\begin{split}
%\begin{align}
%J(\delta x) &= J_{b}(\delta x)+J_{o}(\delta x)+J_{c}(\delta x) \nonumber \\
%& =\frac{1}{2}\delta x^{T}\mathbf{B}^{-1}\delta x\nonumber\\
% & +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{K}(\mathbf{H}_k\mathbf{M}_k \delta x - d_{k})^{T}\mathbf{R}^{-1}(\mathbf{H}_k\mathbf{M}_k \delta x - d_{k})\nonumber\\
% & +J_{c}(\delta x)    
%%\end{split}
%\end{align}
%%\end{equation}

%\begin{align}
%%J(\delta x) &= J_{b}(\delta x)+J_{o}(\delta x)+J_{c}(\delta x)
%J(x_{0}) &= \frac{1}{2}\ (x_{0}-x_{0}^{b})^{T}\mathbf{B}^{-1} (x_{0}-x_{0}^{b})\nonumber\\
%& + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{K}(\mathbf{H}_k\mathbf{M}_k (x_{0}) - y_{0}^{k})^{T}\mathbf{R}^{-1}(\mathbf{H}_k\mathbf{M}_k (x_{0}) - y_{0}^{k})
%\end{align}

%$ \delta x=x_{0}-x_{0}^{b} $  is the analysis increment relative to the model state $ (x_{0}) $ and background $ (x_{0}^{b}) $  at time $0$. $K$ is the total number of time slots on which observations are available. $ \mathbf{B} $ and $ \mathbf{R} $ are covariance matrices for background error and observation error. $ \mathbf{H} $ is the linear approximation of the observation operator $H$  in the vicinity of $ x_{0}^{b} $. $ \mathbf{M} $  is the tangent linear model.  $ d_{k}=y_{k}^{0}-H_k\left[M_k(x_{0}^{b})\right]$ is the innovation vector between observed precipitation $y_{k}^{0}$  and model precipitation at time $k$ . The model precipitation includes non-convective and convective precipitation. The sum of the model precipitation is linearly interpolated to observation location and compared with the observations to generate the innovations. $H$  and $M$  are the nonlinear observation operator and simplified WRF nonlinear model respectively. $J_{c}$  is a balancing term. It measures the quadratic distance between the analysis and a balanced state.

\section{Experiments design and verification methods}
\subsection{Experiments design}

A 10-day period from 0000 UTC 1 to 1200 UTC 10 June 2010 has been selected for running the experiments. This period is chosen because it is characterized by many precipitation events of both convective and stratiform nature. Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW-WRF) \citep{Skamarock} is used as the forecast model. The integration domain of the model covers the North American continent and the surrounding oceans. The horizontal resolution is 30km and there are 40 vertical levels with the model top at 50hPa. The WRF Single-Moment 5-class Microphysics scheme (WSM5)  \citep{Hong}, the Kain-Fritsch cumulus convection scheme \citep{KainFristsch}, and the Yonsei University (YSU) boundary layer parameterization \citep{Hong2006} are used. 

A 6-h spin-up run is conducted using National Center for Environmental Prediction Final Analysis (NCEP FNL) with horizontal spatial resolution of 1.0 x 1.0 degree and the output from the spin-up is used as the initial condition of the COTROL experiment as well as the first guess field for the 4D-Var experiments. The CONTROL run is performed without data assimilation and serves as the benchmark for evaluating the assimilation experiments. The experiment GTS only assimilates conventional observations, while the experiment RAIN only assimilates precipitation data. The experiment GTS+RAIN assimilates both conventional and precipitation data.
Considering to better satisfy the 4D-Var linearity assumption, we choose 6-h accumulated precipitation for 6-h assimilation window instead of assimilating the hourly precipitation. \citet{Lopez} also pointed that the linearity could be much improved by assimilating precipitation observations accumulated over several hours instead of the original hourly data.
2 mm precipitation error is assigned for 6-h accumulated rainfall assimilation, and it will be discussed in more detail in section 4.2. The National Meteorological Center (NMC) method \citep{ParrisDerber} in the WRFDA package is used for background error calculations.
To reduce the computational cost, multi-incremental 4D-Var is used, where the innovation in outer loop is computed with a high-resolution nonlinear model (30 km) and the minimization in inner loop is done with a low-resolution linearized model (90 km). A more detailed description of multi-incremental 4D-Var can be found in \citet{Zhangandhuang} section 3a.

\subsection{Verification methods}

The Model Evaluation Tool (MET) developed by Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) \citep{Brown} is used to evaluate the analyses and forecasts. Two datasets have been used as references. One dataset is the upper air sounding observations, which is used to evaluate model winds, temperature, and relative humidity. Root-mean square errors (RMSEs) are used as the verification metric. The other dataset is the NCEP Stage IV precipitation data. The original precipitation accumulations are available on a 4-km resolution polar-stereographic grid. It has been regrided to 30 km lambert conformal grid before verification. We acquire 12-h, 18-h and 24-h accumulated precipitation by summing of NCEP Stage IV 6-hourly accumulated precipitation. After interpolating and summing, verifications are done by using a grid-to-grid comparison. The Gilbert Skill Score (GSS) \citep{Gilbert} is used as the precipitation verification metric. RMSEs and precipitation scores in section 4 have been calculated for the entire 10-day period of the experiments.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Results} %\label{text}
%The impacts of the precipitation assimilation on the initial fields and forecasts are analyzed in this section through the comparison of the three experiments and with NCEP Stage IV observation.

%\subsection{Profile verification}
\subsection{Impact on model variables}
In order to evaluate how model variables are affected by the precipitation assimilation, RMSEs are computed for wind speed, temperature and relative humidity on different pressure levels.  
Figure 1 gives the vertical profiles of wind speed RMSE for four experiments. The wind speed RMSE of GTS+RAIN and GTS almost overlapped at analysis time (Figure 1a), and they have significant lower RMSE then CONTROL for all levels.  For 12-h and 24-h forecast, although wind speed RMSE of the four experiments are very close, the results of GTS+RAIN are better then other experiments. It reduced the RMSE slightly in the middle and lower levels contrast to other experiments. 
The vertical profiles of temperature RMSE for all experiments are shown in Figure 2. For the RAIN experiment, it adjusted the vertical structure of temperature and reduced the RMSE mostly on lower levels, while it is close to CONTROL on middle and upper levels. For GTS and GTS+RAIN, they give better analyses over all levels compare to CONTROL.
The vertical profiles of relative humidity RMSE for all experiments are shown in Figure 3. The RAIN experiment has positive impact only on 1000hpa but does not produce improvements to most of the levels for moisture field. However, when combining the conventional data to precipitation assimilation, the RMSEs of relative humidity significantly reduced. 
\citet{Zou} pointed that the moisture-related observation reduces the model's freedom in adjusting the moisture field in precipitation assimilation.  
For the moisture-related observation is included in conventional data, GTS+RAIN produces better results than only assimilating precipitation experiment.
From above results, we noticed that the GTS+RAIN mainly improves the low level relative humidity. The positive impact on moisture field is very important for it subsequently influences the latent heat release, alters the thermodynamic and dynamic structure of the atmosphere, and then has influence on the precipitation. 

%\subsection{Precipitation verification}
\subsection{Impact on precipitation}
When dealing with the new type of observations, it is very important to estimate the observations error. According to previous studies, many authors assigned the observation error of accumulated precipitation empirically according to their cases. For example, \citet{Zupanski} used an observed precipitation error of only 0.001 mm for 24-h accumulated precipitation. \citet{Zou} using 0.045mm for 3-h accumulated precipitation. \citet{Guo} used the error of 3 mm for 1-h accumulated precipitation. For there is no available information about the observation error on the NCEP Stage IV precipitation data, the sensitivity of the precipitation forecast to the choice of precipitation error in assimilation experiments was tested. We assigned a series of the observation error by the value of 1, 2, 3, 4mm for 6-h accumulated precipitation. Figure 4 shows the GSSs for 24-h accumulated precipitation using the different precipitation error in assimilation experiment. For a perfect forecast, GSS is 1. The results show that the GSS is the highest at the 1mm and 5mm thresholds when the precipitation assimilation experiment uses 1mm observation error.
However, the advantage is disappeared when threshold is greater than 10mm.  It indicates that the improvement on the small or moderate rain area is limited if we employ a larger error like 4mm or a smaller error like 1mm. In this paper, 2 mm precipitation error for 6-h accumulated precipitation is settled by compromise.

Figure 5 shows threshold series of GSS for 6-h (Figure 5a), 12-h (Figure 5b), 18-h (Figure 5c) and 24-h (Figure 5d) accumulated precipitation for the experiment CONTROL, GTS, RAIN and GTS+RAIN.  
For the RAIN experiment, although the GSS is comparable to GTS+RAIN at 6-h accumulated precipitation, it is worse than GTS+RAIN after 6-h integration. It indicates that, even though the only assimilating precipitation experiment may gives better results within the assimilation window, the improvements on the precipitation forecasts are limited. % It is consistent with the results (figure 4) from Zou and Kuo 1995 which pointed it caused by an erroneous moisture field at the initial time. 
For the experiment GTS, the precipitation forecasts are better than CONTROL but worse than GTS+RAIN, except for 6-h accumulated precipitation. 
It should be noticed that the GSS of GTS and CONTROL are very close (Figure 5b,c,d) for the thresholds lower than 5mm while the RAIN experiment gives better results than GTS in this thresholds range. 
On the whole, GTS+RAIN systematically improved the GSS scores comparing to the only assimilate precipitation or conventional data experiments. Combined conventional data together with precipitation will give much improvements for threshold lower than 5mm, where assimilating conventional data along produced neutral impact on precipitation forecasts. 
The results suggested that the quantitative precipitation forecast can be much improved when we assimilate both conventional and precipitation data.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we use the WRFDA 4D-Var system to assimilate precipitation data. 
A 10-day period containing many precipitation events is selected to assess the impact of precipitation assimilation on short-range forecasts. Four experiments have been conducted: CONTROL— without assimilation; GTS — assimilation of conventional data only; GTS — assimilation of precipitation data only; and GTS+RAIN— assimilation of both conventional and precipitation data. It is found that assimilating precipitation data together with conventional data improves the vertical profile of wind speed, temperature and relative humidity comparing to only assimilating conventional data. 
For the impact on precipitation forecasts, the GSSs of the GTS and RAIN experiment are better than CONTROL but worse than GTS+RAIN.
GTS+RAIN systematically improved the GSS scores comparing to other experiments.
It indicated that assimilating conventional data and precipitation data complement each other in improving the precipitation forecasts skill.
On the one hand, precipitation data in the GTS+RAIN experiment improve the precipitation forecasts especially on the small rain area where assimilating only conventional data produced neutral impact, on the other, conventional observations especially the moisture-related data in GTS+RAIN experiment constrains 
the arbitrarily adjusting of the moisture analysis in precipitation assimilation then improve the subsequent forecasts.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads

%  IN-TEXT LISTS

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with the first character following the equal sign on the first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g. \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
