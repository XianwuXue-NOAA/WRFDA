\section{The Data Assimilation Problem} % section headings are printed smaller than chapter names
% intro
This document provides a reference for technical details of the 4DVAR system for WRF ARW. The code has been designed to be a community data assimilation system flexible enough to allow a variety of research studies to be performed (e.g. impact of new observation types, globally relocatable etc). In addition, the code has from the start of the project been geared towards operational implementation. Thus, the issues of computational efficiency and robustness have also been major design features. Results from initial operational applications of the 3DVAR system with MM5 can be found in Barker et al. (2003).

In the remainder of this introductory section, a brief discussion of the general data assimilation problem is given followed by a short introduction to variational data assimilation. Finally, motivations for developing the 4DVAR system for WRF are outlined. Section 2 provides an overview of the 4DVAR system in WRF applications including a description of the various components specially written for use with 4DVAR. Section 3 describes one of these components - the observation preprocessor used to quality control and format observations ready for input into 4DVAR. The 4DVAR code itself is reviewed in section 4. Sections 5 to 7 describe in turn the three components of the 4DVAR control variable transform used to allow practical minimization of the 4DVAR cost-function. The complexity and sensitivity of components of a variational data assimilation system requires constant checks on the code and input data. In addition to the two primary sources of input data (observations and a previous background forecast), estimates of observation and background error are required to compute the analysis. In the current system, the background error covariance matrix is approximated via the "NMC-method" of averaging forecast differences. The code developed for this purpose is described in section 8. In order to run a bounded forecast model from the analysis, lateral boundary conditions must be modified to take account of the differences between background and analysis fields. The "update\_bc" code performs this task and is described in section 9. In section 10 a description is given of the methods used to permit 4DVAR to be run on multiple processor platforms. The appendices contain background and technical information on various aspects of the 4DVAR system.

Different organised systems have different energy currencies. The machines that enable us to do science like sizzling electricity but at a controlled voltage. Earth's living beings are no different, except that they have developed another preference. They thrive on various chemicals. 

% dextran, starch, glycogen
Most organisms use polymers of glucose units for energy storage and differ only slightly in the way they link together monomers to sometimes gigantic macromolecules. Dextran of bacteria is made from long chains of $\alpha$-1,6-linked glucose units. 

%: ----------------------- HELP: special characters
% above you can see how special characters are coded; e.g. $\alpha$
% below are the most frequently used codes:
%$\alpha$  $\beta$  $\gamma$  $\delta$

%$^{chars to be superscripted}$  OR $^x$ (for a single character)
%$_{chars to be suberscripted}$  OR $_x$

%>  $>$  greater,  <  $<$  less
%≥  $\ge$  greater than or equal, ≤  $\ge$  lesser than or equal
%~  $\sim$  similar to

%$^{\circ}$C   ° as in degree C
%±  \pm     plus/minus sign

%$\AA$     produces  Å (Angstrom)




% dextran, starch, glycogen continued
Starch of plants and glycogen of animals consists of $\alpha$-1,4-glycosidic glucose polymers \cite{lastname07}. See figure \ref{largepotato} for a comparison of glucose polymer structure and chemistry. 

Two references can be placed separated by a comma \cite{lastname07,name06}.

%: ----------------------- HELP: references
% References can be links to figures, tables, sections, or references.
% For figures, tables, and text you define the target of the link with \label{XYZ}. Then you call cross-link with the command \ref{XYZ}, as above
% Citations are bound in a very similar way with \cite{XYZ}. You store your references in a BibTex file with a programme like BibDesk.

%: ----------------------- HELP: adding figures with macros
% This template provides a very convenient way to add figures with minimal code.
% \figuremacro{1}{2}{3}{4} calls up a series of commands formating your image.
% 1 = name of the file without extension; PNG, JPEG is ok; GIF doesn't work
% 2 = title of the figure AND the name of the label for cross-linking
% 3 = caption text for the figure

%: ----------------------- HELP: www links
% You can also see above how, www links are placed
% \href{http://www.something.net}{link text}

\figuremacroW{largepotato}{Title}{Caption}{0.8}
% variation of the above macro with a width setting
% \figuremacroW{1}{2}{3}{4}
% 1-3 as above
% 4 = size relative to text width which is 1; use this to reduce figures




Insulin stimulates the following processes:

\begin{itemize}
\item muscle and fat cells remove glucose from the blood,
\item cells breakdown glucose via glycolysis and the citrate cycle, storing its energy in the form of ATP,
\item liver and muscle store glucose as glycogen as a short-term energy reserve,
\item adipose tissue stores glucose as fat for long-term energy reserve, and
\item cells use glucose for protein synthesis.
\end{itemize}

%: ----------------------- HELP: lists
% This is how you generate lists in LaTeX.
% If you replace {itemize} by {enumerate} you get a numbered list.


 


%: ----------------------- HELP: tables
% Directly coding tables in latex is tiresome. See below.
% I would recommend using a converter macro that allows you to make the table in Excel and convert them into latex code which you can then paste into your doc.
% This is the link: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/Excel2Latex.shtml
% It's a Excel template file containing a macro for the conversion.

\begin{table}[htdp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc} % ccc means 3 columns, all centered; alternatives are l, r

{\bf Gene} & {\bf GeneID} & {\bf Length} \\ 
% & denotes the end of a cell/column, \\ changes to next table row
\hline % draws a line under the column headers

human latexin & 1234 & 14.9 kbps \\
mouse latexin & 2345 & 10.1 kbps \\
rat latexin   & 3456 & 9.6 kbps \\
% Watch out. Every line must have 3 columns = 2x &. 
% Otherwise you will get an error.

\end{tabular}
\caption[title of table]{\textbf{title of table} - Overview of latexin genes.}
% You only need to write the title twice if you don't want it to appear in bold in the list of tables.
\label{latexin_genes} % label for cross-links with \ref{latexin_genes}
\end{table}



% There you go. You already know the most important things.
