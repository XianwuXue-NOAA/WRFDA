# The TestAll.csh script in the home directory of the distribution provides a sanity check test 
# by running all tests in the run/namelist.input file. The test script will halt with a failure if 
# abs(TL-ADJ) > epsilon for any test. The value of epsilon may be modified in the script and by default is ???.
#
# This script, with the default epsilon value should be run before checking in any source code changes.
