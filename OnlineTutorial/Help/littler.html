      <blockquote>
        <p class="style5" id="Font16">What the heck is LITTLE_R?</p>

        <p class="bodytext"><b>LITTLE_R</b> is an ASCII-based observation file format, in use since the MM5 era. Because raw observation data files have many possible formats (such as ASCII, BUFR, PREPBUFR, MADIS, and HDF) LITTLE_R is designed to be an intermediate format so that WRFDA might be able to assimilate as many observation types as possible in a universal manner. It is a report-based file format, so all manner of observation types can easily be "cat-ted" together into an easy-to-read and -edit text file.</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><b>It is the user's responsibility to develop an interface to convert their own observations to LITTLE_R format</b> so they may be read by OBSPROC. We do not support any existing tools which do this. However, on this help page, we hope to describe the format as thoroughly as possible to aid the user in the conversion process.</p>
        <p class="style5" id="Font16">What is the LITTLE_R format?</p>
        <p class="bodytext">A LITTLE_R file is composed of <em>reports</em>. These reports are composed of <em>records</em>: a header (detailing the specific data reported by this type of observation), the data itself (organized in a way specified by the header values), and three tail integers. These records are composed of <em>fields</em>: these fields contain the definitions for the data indicated by this observation type (in the header record) and the individual pieces of data for each observation (in the data record).</p>

      <p class="bodytext"><strong id="Font14">The header record</strong> </p>
      <p class="bodytext"></p>

<!-- 

THE FOLLOWING SEEMS TO BE INCORRECT, BUT I'D LIKE TO SAVE IT JUST IN CASE

     These tail integers only have meaning for when you have duplicate reports (two observations at the same location and time); there are three checks done by the "merge_obs" subroutine (in file var/obsproc/src/module_obs_merge.F90): first, if one report has more levels than the other, the one with fewer levels is discarded. Otherwise, if one has fewer write errors or fewer warnings, it is discarded. Otherwise, the first report (by order in the LITTLE_R file) is kept and the other discarded. As you can see, these are not really important for almost all cases (the number of errors should be zero if you have written your program correctly, unless there is a problem with your initial data), which is why we don't go into this much detail in the presentation I sent you.

            <span class="style5">Hold on... I think my computer might already have netCDF installed!</span><br>
            Even if netCDF is already installed on your machine, we recommend that you compile your own version of the libraries, since the exact version and compilers used are so important. The process only takes about 30 minutes, and the libraries only take up around 11 Mb of space, so this should not be burdensome even for those on a tight computing and/or time budget.

      <p class="bodytext"><strong id="Font14">Step 1: Download and unzip the netCDF source code</strong> </p>
      <p class="bodytext">NetCDF can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp">Unidata netCDF download page</a>. WRFDA is not yet compatible with the most recent version of netCDF, so you should scroll down to the bottom section titled "Old netCDF Bundled C/C++/Fortran Releases" and select the most recent link in that section. As of October 2012, this is version 4.1.3. From that page, click the link to download the most recent <em>stable</em> release of the netCDF source code, and save it to a convenient folder.</p>
      <p class="bodytext">Now that you have downloaded the netCDF source code, it is time to configure the code to your environment and compile. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory in which you saved the netCDF tarball (netcdf-4.1.3.tar.gz) and un-tar it.</p>
      <p class="code">tar -xvf netcdf-4.1.3.tar.gz</p>


      <p class="bodytext"><strong id="Font14">Step 2: Configure and compile</strong> </p>
      <p class="bodytext">Now, navigate to the folder you just un-tarred. Now it is time to select your compilers (again, if you are unsure of which compilers to use, see the <a href="configuration.html">Configuration Help Page</a>). Set the environment variable "FC" to the name of the Fortran compiler you will be using, and set "CC" to the name of the C compiler you will be using. We highly recommend using gfortran and gcc if possible.</p>
MAKE A NOTE HERE: IF "SETENV" DOESN'T WORK, YOU ARE LIKELY USING A DIFFERENT TERMINAL SHELL. SEE OUR TERMINAL SHELL HELP PAGE.
      <p class="code">setenv FC gfortran</p>
      <p class="code">setenv CC gcc</p>
      <p class="bodytext">Finally, you should configure netCDF so it will install in the correct folder. Typically netCDF will install in the /usr/local directory by default, but if you do not have administrative privileges on your machine, you will need to set your own directory. Any directory that you can write to will suffice; for demonstration purposes, we will use <span class="style6" id="Font12">/user/home/jdoe/netcdf_4.1.3</span> as our installation directory. Ensure that you are in the netcdf source directory that you just unpacked, and enter the following:</p>
      <p class="bodytext">The <span class="style6" id="Font12">./configure</span> script will run a large number of checks, and if successful will end with no error messages. Once the script is finished, complete the installation by entering the following:
      <p class="code">make check install</p>
      <p class="bodytext">If everything works correctly, a long series of "make" commands will end with a message beginning with "Congratulations! You have successfully installed netCDF!". If you see this message, you are done, and can move on to the <a href="../Introduction/start.html">tutorial branch that best suits you</a>.</p>
